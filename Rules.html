<h1> Official Rules and Regulations</h1>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>
Teams will be made up of 6 players.  Six players will compete on a side; one alternate may be available as a substitute.
</p>

<h3>The Equipment</h3>
<p>
Ten balls will be in play.
</p>

<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>
The objective of the game is to eliminate all opposing players by getting them "OUT".  This may be done by:
<ol>
	<li>Hitting an opposing player with a LIVE ball.  Hits in the head do not count, and do not penalize the thrower, however if the player who is hit is bending over to get a ball, the player who is hit is out, which is judged by the court monitor</li>
	<li>Catching a LIVE ball thrown by your opponent.</li>
	<li>Catching a LIVE ball will also allow a team member that is out to come back in</li>
</ol>
LIVE ball: <i>A ball that has been thrown and has not touched anything, including the floor/ground, another ball, another player, official or other item outside the playing field (wall, ceiling, etc.)</i>
</p>

<h3>Boundaries</h3>
<p>
During play, all players must remain within the boundary lines except when retrieving balls, however an excessive period of time retrieving balls will result in the player being "OUT".
</p>

<h3>The Opening Rush</h3>
<p>
Game begins by placing the dodgeballs along the centerline.  Players then take a position behind their end line.  Following a signal by the official, teams may approach the centerline to retrieve the balls.  This signal official starts the contest; however, players must return to their respective end lines before throwing any balls across the centerline.
</p>

<h3>Timing and Winning a Game</h3>
<p>
The first team to legally eliminate all opposing players will be declared the winner.  A 5-minute time limit has been established for each contest.  If neither team has been eliminated at the end of the 5 minutes, the team with the greater number of players remaining will be declared the winner.
</p>

<h3>5-Second Violation</h3>
<p>
In order to reduce stalling, a violation will be called if a team in the lead controls (8) or more balls on their side of the court for more than 5 seconds.  This also applies to tied teams.
</p>

<h3>Rule Enforcement</h3>
<p>
During the tournament, rules will be enforced primarily by the court monitor.  The court monitor will decide if a team member has legally been eliminated, or if a rule has been violated.  If a rule has been violated the court monitor has the authority to freeze matches, eliminate players, allow players back in or any other action that would solve game discrepancies.  THE COURT MONITOR'S DECISION IS FINAL - NO EXCEPTIONS.
